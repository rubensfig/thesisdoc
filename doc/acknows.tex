\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
%\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Agradecimentos}

First of all, I'd like to thank my supervisor Dr. Ana Aguiar, for the constant support and guidance that was provided. I'd would also like to thank for the 
opportunity of finishing my master's thesis in a foreign company, and spending these past few months in Germany was an amazing experience.

\par The constant environment of teaching and support provided by Dr. Hagen Woesner and the team at BISDN was undoubtedly a big factor to my adjustment in Germany.
The experience I gained there, both technically and personally was a big mark during the development of this thesis, and the working atmosphere contributed immensely
for my integration there.

\par Next I would like to thank my mom, my dad and my brother, for the immense support that they showed during my time here and abroad, and the understanding that 
only they could provide.

\par Finally, I thank my group of friends that helped me grow during these past few years, and the motivation they always gave me.
