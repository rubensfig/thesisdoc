\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
%\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Agradecimentos}

First of all, I'd like to thank my supervisor Dr. Ana Aguiar, for the constant support and guidance that was provided. I'd would also like to thank for the 
opportunity of finishing my master's thesis in a foreign company, and spending these past few months in Germany was an amazing experience.

\par The constant environment of teaching and support provided by Dr. Hagen Woesner and the team at BISDN was undoubtedly a big factor in my adjustment in Germany.
The experience I gained, both technically and personally was a big mark during the development of this thesis, and the working atmosphere contributed immensely
for my integration there.

\par Next I would like to thank my parents and brother, for the immense support that they showed during my here and abroad, and the understanding that only they 
could provide during these past few years. 

\par Finally, I send a special for the group of people that helped me grow during these past few years.
