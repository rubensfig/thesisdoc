\section {Problem Definition} %% Title in progress
\hspace{0.5cm}

The previous chapter in finding the existing work done in the field of managed Wi-Fi systems serves as an introduction for this chapter. Following a proposition from BISDN, a Berlin based company that deal with Software Defined Networks, the proposed problem is the implementation of a cloud database solution to save customers session data in a safe and redundant way. 

\par In the initial stage of the solution for this problem, the research on the state-of-the-art consisted in the definition of the requirements of managed networks, and researching the various possible technologies to better get a sense of the scope of the work. We define then the basic requirements that need to be met, and along with the previously noted requirements, the establishment of a stable connection, a secure system, to ensure users privacy and a redundant storage of information.


\section {Proposed Solution} %% 
\hspace{0.5cm}

The proposed solution is a feature that is capable of meeting the above presented requirements, and correctly integrate the already existing system done by the company. The specific technologies to be used are to be continually researched, and to be further explored when starting the work on the thesis.
