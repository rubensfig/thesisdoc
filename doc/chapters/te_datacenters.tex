\chapter {Traffic engineering in data centers}

Undestanding the impact that of elephant flows in the normal operation of data centers require understanding the traffic characteristics of typical cloud data center deployments. Designing a cloud data center is a considered a 
challenging task, since the observed workloads may differ based on services that are deployed. Furthermore, DCNs requirements is information that is not usually public, which poses a greater challenge for researchers.
