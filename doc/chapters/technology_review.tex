After a brief introduction, encompassing the history, and some of the requirements in the technologies that support the developed work, this chapter focuses on giving a detailed description of the infrastructure supporting 
the developed work. This chapter is organized in the following matter: in the first section, we focus on SDN/NFV platforms, and the OpenFlow platform; in the second section, an introduction to cloud computing is the main topic,
while also clarifying some of concepts of containerization and virtualization, and how these techniques support the SDN model; in section three, some methods of describing links are explained; in section four, there is an
