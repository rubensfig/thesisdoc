\section {Problem}

Developing solutions for use in mission critical environments requires the deep understanding and analysis of the requirements present, so that random ocurrences and bugs do not happen in clients. As such, the problem posed is 
the construction of a management API and visualization tool that allows network operators to manage their infrastructure. The development of this thesis was done under the supervision of BISDN, and the final solution must 
integrate their already existing environments, and provide a way to manage them, by exposing an interative way to display the topology, set VLAN's, and display the port statistics. 

\par Also addressed by this system should be the setting of Quality-of-Service policies, that maintains the levels of accepted behaviour of each device in the network, and identifies and applies some automatic mitigation
strategy when the system does not perform according to normal state. By understanding data center traffic characteristics, one of the largest problems are the existence of \textit{elephant flows}, that impact the
overall bandwidth of the network. As such, the development of a full management system should also include the definition of a system that receives the incoming port statistics, analyses these, and does some statistical analysis to
manage and recover from the impact caused by elephant flows.
