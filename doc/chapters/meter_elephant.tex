\section {Algorithm design}
\subsection {Formal definition}

A time series can be defined as a stream of observations $X = \{x_1, ... x_i\}$, where $x_i$ is a vector arriving at time $i$, and

\begin {equation}
\centering
x_i = 
\begin{bmatrix}
B_{RX}\\
P_{RX}\\
B_{TX}\\
P_{TX}\\
\end{bmatrix}
\end {equation}

\par $B_{XX}$ and $P_{XX}$ describe to the port statistics obtained from the controller, the byte and packet counters, respectively, and the indexes describe if the counters account for the transmitted or received data in that port.
