\chapter{Testing setup and environment} \label{chap:me} %% chapter 3

\section {Introduction}

In the next sections, we discuss and evaluate the environment used for generating and evaluating the test results. The testing environment aims to replicate the lower layers of the data center topologies, as demonstrated in 
figure \ref{nm/fattree}, due to faster response of mitigation of the elephant flows, generating less impact in the network, as seen in \cite { CITE - http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7366826/}, while also reducing the 
resource consumption of physical memory and processing power associated with creating very large virtualized networks.
