\begin{abstract}
The rising requirements of today's cloud services require the evolution of networking infrastructure to support the increasing amount of data that is processed
every day. This means that data center network operators must design or adapt their cloud networking environments to provide a stable and reliable connection.
Better optimized infrastructure often also means cost reductions in network utilization and energy savings.

\par As networks grow larger and more complex, systems must be put in place that allow for closely monitoring the resources that make up the network, while also 
allowing for a certain freedom for the possible constant change of the network. As such, typical vendor solutions don't really fit into this ever changing landscape,
since they present very solid and vertically integrated solutions. The Software Defined Networking paradigm, however, is able to solve this issue, since it enables
the centralized control of the underlying networks, providing visibility and control over the network's devices, simplifying error diagnosis and troubleshooting. 

\par In this work we propose a modular management system for cloud data center Software Defined Networking controllers, providing system administrators a simple
platform to view their network's topology, monitor networking devices ports, etc. The modularity also provides a simple platform to extend the functionality 
of the networking controllers, that can be used to implement detection of network abnormalities and optimize flow forwarding paths, among others.

\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} rapid expansion of the cloud computing environment in the previous decade is related to the increasing demand in computational power that 
applications like distributed databases or data analysis have. Public cloud solutions like Amazon's Web Services, Microsoft's Azure, or private solutions offered
through OpenStack provide a very large pool of resources for developers to deploy applications with ease. 

\par Using open source applications and whitebox hardware has also contributed to the success of these environments, due to the possible cost reductions. Software
Defined Networking (SDN), has proven to be a reliable environment to manage data center environments, due to the centralization of the network
controllers, improved programmability of the network's data plane, and improved management systems. Network programmability, despite not being exclusive to the 
SDN framework, eliminates the effort in individually configuring every network device, which in large scale environments becomes an impossible task. 

\par Due to data center's traffic profile, one common challenge for optimizing the networks resource utilization is the asymmetry of traffic, where most of the 
networking flows are short-lived, latency-sensitive quick bursts of packets, but do not amount for the total traffic in the network. The main contributor for the 
total traffic volume are the large and long-lived flows, usually called elephant flows. By maintaining a system that monitors and alarms network operators of the
occurrences of large data streams, this will provide insight to the network operators to plan ahead their network resources.

\par This document is organized in:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Related Work} is an overview of Software-Defined Networking environments and presenting information on the existing applications. 
    \item \textbf{Proposed Architecture} details the proposed architecture for this work, and the technologies used for implementation;
    \item \textbf{Results} displays the developed Graphical User Interface, and the results of the change detection method implemented for monitoring elephant flows;
    \item \textbf{Conclusion} sums up the main contributions of this work.
\end{itemize}

\section{Related Work}

\par Mahout \cite{curtis_mahout:_2011} presents a system that allows for elephant flow detection by monitoring end hosts. Via implementation of a shim layer on top 
of every host present in the network, the proposed system allows to tag the traffic that belongs to larger flows, reducing the complexity that is generated if the 
monitoring was done at the aggregation or core switches. Detection itself is done by comparing the number of bytes in a buffer to a pre-defined threshold. In
Hedera \cite{al-fares_hedera:_2010} the problem of maximizing network bandwidth is via detection of large flows and optimization of the placement on the switches
according to the demands of these flows. A sampling approach for detection of network anomalies is explored in \cite{jun_ddos_2014}, where the proposed method 
relies on analysing the sampled packets and building a tuple of the traffic characteristics (source and destination IP, source and destination ports, and the 
protocol).

\section{Proposed Architecture}

\par We build an Operations Support System (OSS) that provides the basis for the development of applications that monitor the state of the network, using an
implemented API to obtain the relevant information. This system allows further separation of roles in the network, in contrast to a system where the controller would
gather the roles of managing and monitor the network’s status, increasing the load on the controllers. Furthermore, this architecture increases the modularity of 
the components, enabling hot-swapping different modules, and allows parallel development of different features in the monitoring and management stack.

\par We provide a proof-of-concept composed of two components: the first is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) providing an user friendly interface to display 
topology and statistics, and the second is an intelligent system enabling the detection of elephant flows. In this section we describe in a high level way the 
approaches for the development of this system.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Graphical User Interface}

The connection between both controllers to the GUI provides the view for both controllers, which means that CAWR will present the view for the physical switches, 
bonded ports and hosts, while the baseboxd only shows the giant switch created by CAWR. Analysis of the global view of the state of the
network, include the addition of displaying configured VLANs in each port, and even provide a way to configure these VLANS via a GUI. Interaction with the nodes is 
possible, and clicking on each provides an insight to the statistics related to the ports in that node.

\subsection{Elephant Flow Monitoring}

\begin{algorithm}[H]
    \caption{Elephant Detection Algorithm - High Level} \label{alg:high_level}
    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
        \Procedure {Elephant Flow Detection}{}
            \State Initialization
            \State Query controller
            \Loop
                \State Calculate prediction error
                \State Predict next values
                \State Detection
                \If {Detection}
                    \State Raise Alarm
                \EndIf
                \State wait 2 seconds
            \EndLoop
        \EndProcedure
       \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\par The initialization step of the algorithm is a crucial step for obtaining correct results in the algorithm, since they allow the correct initialization of
the model parameters to provide a baseline for the expected traffic on the network. It is assumed that no traffic abnormalities exist during this stage.

\par Time series analysis can generate forecasts for future values, assuming the temporal behaviour is maintained for future observations. During the design phase 
of the algorithm, we selected the exponential smoothing technique, since this is a commonly used technique in the reviewed literature \cite{jasek_usage_2013, 
munz_traffic_2010}, and provides a generally simple way to generate forecasts based in historical data.

\par One of the analysed change detection methods is the CUSUM algorithm. This method is used for monitoring parameters of a sample, by monitoring deviations of the
observations according to a certain target value. Typical implementations of this algorithm are based in an offline approach, calculating the alarm times
with knowledge of the entire data set. The adaptation of the CUSUM algorithm for utilization as an online technique is based on a sliding window that
is updated with every new sample. Applying this method has the advantages of using the CUSUM algorithm without needing extensive changes, while also reducing the 
amount of memory needed to apply this method.

\section{Conclusion}
% referências
\par We have built a management environment that extends the previously existing SDN controllers, allowing developments in the field of Traffic Engineering in the 
Basebox environment. We have also designed a Graphical User Interface for interaction with the users, allowing for simple visualisation of the network’s physical 
topology, and the display of interfaces’ statistics, like the packets and bytes received and sent, or the number of errors.

\par We have also proposed an algorithm that allows for monitoring traffic changes in ports, in order to detect elephant flows in the network. We have shown that a 
simple method can be employed by operators to monitor the state of their network, and rely on this algorithm to provide them with alarms of port changes.
